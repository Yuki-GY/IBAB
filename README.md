# IBAB
We give the code of BAB algorithm, Exhuastive algorithm, Greedy search and I-BAB algorithm.
You can run those code by MATLAB.
When you use IBAB algorithm to compare with other algorithms, the two parameters MAX and MIN can be the same. If you merely apply IBAB algorithm alone, the MAX and MIN can be different values,but MIN masu be smaller than MAX.
if there is other question,please contact me with gyj136039587@gmail.com.
